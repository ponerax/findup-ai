# FindUP AI Project

The FindUP AI project was envisioned as a cutting-edge tool designed to revolutionize the discovery of emerging Alpha projects on Twitter. By leveraging advanced AI, FindUP AI aimed to provide users with real-time market analytics, empowering their decision-making process in trading with unmatched speed and precision. However, the project did not proceed to launch. As the main contributor, focusing solely on the development of the website, I have decided to make this project public. My hope is that it may serve as inspiration or a resource for future innovations within the community.

## Project Vision

FindUP AI was created to detect early signs of potential Alpha projects through in-depth analysis performed by our internally developed AI, named FindUP. It promised to deliver exclusive insights and calls directly to users, facilitated through a user-friendly interface accessible via Telegram. This initiative was not just about providing tools but also aimed at building a knowledgeable community around Alpha discovery in the Web3 space.
